### MulSKIPS
A Kinetic Monte Carlo super-Lattice code, designed to simulate with atomic resolution the kinetics of processes (e.g., PVD, CVD, laser annealing) involving elements, alloys and compounds characterized by the sp3 bond symmetry

### INSTALLATION 

- To compile MulSKIPS use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/MulSKIPS/MulSKIPS.git
cd /your_MulSKIPS_directory/mulskips-source/ 
make 
```

If something goes wrong, please double check (and edit, if needed) the makefile, and ensure that your GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran or f95) is updated (tested version >= 9.4.0).
A successful compilation will generate a "mulskips.e" executable file in the /your_MulSKIPS_directory/mulskips-source/ directory.

- To run a simulation, go to your working directory, use pymulskips routines to generate a "start.dat" file with all simulation parameters, then simply call  /your_MulSKIPS_directory/mulskips.e  
- To use the pymulskips routines in your python script, simply copy the directory /your_MulSKIPS_directory/pymulskips/ into your working directory.
In alternative, you can add /your_MulSKIPS_directory/pymulskips/ to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
- The pymulskips module needs a lot of dependencies. You can install them manually or running the following command:
```
pip3 install -r /your_MulSKIPS_directory/pymulskips/requirements.txt
```
- For examples of usage, see /your_MulSKIPS_directory/examples/.




### MORE DOCUMENTATION and EXAMPLE on PVD, CVD, LASER ANNEALING processes for various materials (Si, SiC, SiGe, ...) will be uploaded soon, so...STAY TUNED!
