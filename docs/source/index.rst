Welcome to MulSKIPS's documentation!
====================================

The `MulSKIPS` project regroups all files which are needed
to install, run and employ the MulSKIPS code for production calculations.
It takes on board also all pre- and post-processing jupyter notebooks used
to build up MulSKIPS input files, to perform the calibration of input parameters,
to build input structures, and to analyse all MulSKIPS outputs.
Such modules are supposed to enhance the MulSKIPS experience by high-level approach.
