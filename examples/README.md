This folder contains different examples of simulations performed with MulSKIPS.

Here is a list (more detailed Jupyter Notebooks will be released soon):

- ex1. (COMING SOON) How to calibrate a MulSKIPS simulation of PVD (3C-SiC growth from Si, SiC2 and Si2C precursors). 
- ex2. (COMING SOON) How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of PVD for 3C-SiC setting up various pre-defined input geometries.
- ex3. (COMING SOON) How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of Si and Ge melting and solidification (reproducing Fulcher-Vogel curves of interface speed vs. temperature)
- ex4. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of laser annealing processes for SiGe random alloys. It focuses on calibration and on coupling the KMC on super-lattice to the a finite elements method solver implemented in FENICS.
- ex5. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD. It focuses on calibration (including coupling with external gas-phase solvers), setup of various input geometries (surface, nanowire, FDSOI...) and I/O capabilities (from importing a geometry in GMSH format to exporting the final surface atoms for further post-processing).

Further TUTORIALS and EXAMPLES will be uploaded soon.
