This folder contains different tutorials and usage examples of MulSKIPS.

Here is a list of the examples/tutorials:

- ex1. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of PVD SiC-3C growth, with Si, SiC2 and Si2C as precursors
- ex2. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD Si growth, with H2 and SiH4 as precursors
- ex3. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of ultra-fast Si melting
- ex4. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of a Si laser annealing process (This is also based on MulSKIPS IO interface to CAD and FENICS)
- ex5. How to run a a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD SiNW (FDSOI) growth starting from a MSH file and exporting the final surface atoms
- ex6. How to analyze the results of MulSKIPS 
- ex7. How to setup a process calibration in MulSKIPS
