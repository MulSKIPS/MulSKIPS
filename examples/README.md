This folder contains different examples of simulations performed with MulSKIPS.

Here is a list (more detailed Jupyter Notebooks will be released soon):

- ex1. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of PVD SiC-3C growth, with Si, SiC2 and Si2C as precursors
- ex2. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD Si growth, with H2 and SiH4 as precursors
- ex3. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of Si and Ge melting and solidification (reproducing Fulcher-Vogel curves of interface speed vs. temperature)
- ex4. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of SiGe laser annealing processes (including MulSKIPS IO interface to CAD and FENICS)
- ex5. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD SiNW and FDSOI growth starting from a GMSH file and exporting the final surface atoms
- ex6. How to analyze the results of MulSKIPS 
- ex7. How to setup a process calibration in MulSKIPS


Further TUTORIALS and EXAMPLES will be uploaded soon.
