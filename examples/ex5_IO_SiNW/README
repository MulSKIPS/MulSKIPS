To run this example you need at least 5 GB free storage,
to allocate 2 large auxiliary DAT files which can be removed after the run if you want.
These contain the geometry information needed to import the mesh into MulSKIPS.
BUT keep them in the folder to avoid repeating the slow (a couple of hours on a good machine) MSH-MulSKIPS interpolation 
in case you want to repeat only the KMC run, which is mush faster (minutes).
No MPI is used.
