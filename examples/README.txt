This folder contains different tutorials and usage examples of MulSKIPS, in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
Most examples make use of the pymulskips library, which should be in your $PYTHONPATH.
Otherwise you can make a copy of pymulskips in the working directory.

It might be useful to make a copy of the mulskips-source directory as well in your working directory.

Here is a list of the examples/tutorials:

ex1. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of PVD SiC-3C growth, with Si, SiC2 and Si2C as precursors
ex2. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD Si growth, with H2 and SiH4 as precursors
ex3. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of ultra-fast Si melting
ex4. How to run a MulSKIPS simulation of a Si laser annealing process
   (This is also based on MulSKIPS IO interface to CAD and FENICS)
ex5. How to run a a MulSKIPS simulation of CVD SiNW growth starting from a MSH file and exporting the final surface atoms
ex6. How to analyze the results of MulSKIPS 
ex7. How to setup a process calibration in MulSKIPS
